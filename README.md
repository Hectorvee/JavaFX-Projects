## Introduction
Welcome to the JavaFX Projects repository! This document will guide you through a series of JavaFX projects designed to enhance your understanding and skills in JavaFX programming.

## About JavaFX
JavaFX is a software platform for creating and delivering desktop applications, as well as rich internet applications (RIAs) that can run across a wide variety of devices. It is intended to replace Swing as the standard GUI library for Java SE.

## How to Use This Document
This document is structured to take you through various problems and projects in JavaFX, starting from the basics and progressing to more complex concepts. Each section contains problems with descriptions and hints on how to solve them.

## Recommended Prerequisites
Before starting these projects, it is recommended that you have a basic understanding of Java programming. Familiarity with concepts such as classes, objects, inheritance, and basic GUI programming will be beneficial.
